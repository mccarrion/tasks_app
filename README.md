# todo_app
A ToDo app made with LVGL and SDL2

## Note

You will need to download lvgl from here: https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl and then drop the entire folder into your project
so that your project can build with the lvgl code. You can add "/lvgl" to your gitignore so you do not commit all that
code to your repository.
